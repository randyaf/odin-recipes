                    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>½ cup granulated sugar(100 g)</li>
                        <li>¾ cup brown sugar(165 g), packed</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>½ cup unsalted butter(115 g), melted</li>
                        <li>1 egg</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>4 oz milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks(110 g)</li>
                        <li>4 oz dark chocolate chunk(110 g), or your preference</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="step">
                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
                        <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
                        <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
                        <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
                        <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
                        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
                        <li>cool completely before serving, enjoy!</li>
